Using this framework you can easily present images in a scroll view using a page controll to indicate the current page.

The main capabilities of the framework are:
    - download images from the internet in a separate thread by only giving an array of urls (image urls)
    - give it an array of UIImage objects
    - implement a delegate and manage the image for each page yourself


Under the AFImageViewer group you can find the image viewer files
